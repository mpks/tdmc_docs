TDMC Documentation
===================================

The ``tdmc`` (Time-Dependent Monte Carlo) is a Python package for simulating 
coupled electron-phonon dynamics in tight-binding systems driven by external
electric field. The code solves a system of coupled equations, one for the 
electrons and one for the phonons, either at the zero or at nonzero
temperatures.
